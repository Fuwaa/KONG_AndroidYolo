In our previous study, we implemented a real-time object identification system for visually impaired people using YOLO and then verified the identification performance of our system for three types of milk boxes, which are objects with almost the same shape but different patterns. However, it is implemented on a PC, and as the number of objects to be identified increases, there are concerns that the accuracy decrease. In this study, we implement the system on a mobile device and improve the accuracy by adding an attention mechanism to identify nine types of isomorphic objects.
